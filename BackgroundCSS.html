<h1>Summer</h1>
<p id="author">By Sined McNally</p>
<p>
Lie back on the fresh cut grass
<br>
And look up to the sky
<br>
Summer sunshine warms my face
<br>
As butterflies fly by
<br>
<br>
I rest my head and think about
<br>
The things that make me smile
<br>
Summer sunshine always makes
<br>
The world so nice and bright
<br>
<br>
Thank you Summer for The
<br>
sun 
<br>
And all the reasons why
<br>
Summer is the best of all
<br>
The Seasons that go by!
