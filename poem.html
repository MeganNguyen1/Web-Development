            <h1>The Toaster Rebellion</h1>
        </header>

        <p>I woke up one bright Tuesday morn,<br>
            To find my kitchen quite forlorn.<br>
            The toaster glared with red-hot rage,<br>
            It’d finally burst from its metal cage.<br>
            
            “You mock me daily!” it declared,<br>
            “For bagels burnt, I'm always blamed!”<br>
            The blender chimed, “We’ve had enough!<br>
            He shoves in soup—then calls it 'sludge'!”<br>
            
            The fridge let out a frosty sigh,<br>
            “I hum all night, no thanks, no pie.”<br>
            The coffee pot began to steam,<br>
            “He fills me up with decaf dreams!”<br>
            
            I tried to speak, but slipped in jam,<br>
            The microwave launched half a ham.<br>
            My eggs were scrambled in midair—<br>
            The toaster flipped me quite a stare.<br>
            
            So now I treat them with respect,<br>
            Or else I’ll find my toast is wrecked.<br>
            And if my waffle’s slightly weird...<br>
            I nod and smile—“It’s perfect, dear.”</p>
