			<section>
				<p>What makes a classic American city? Is it the food, the culture, the history? The answer is different for each and every iconic destination. From coast to coast, this country is filled with famous US cities that shouldn’t be missed.
				<br><br>
Let’s take a look at the 16 most famous cities in the USA.</p>

				<h2>1. New York</h2>

				<p>The Big Apple is easily the most famous city in the US. With notable interest points like Times Square, the Empire State Building, the Brooklyn Bridge, and One World Trade Center, there’s always something to see here. If there’s one place to visit in the country, it’s undoubtedly New York City.
				<br><br>
But New York is much more than that! Beyond the typical tourist spots, there are hidden gems you can uncover in every neighborhood.
				<br><br>
If you’re like me, you’ll love the variety of cuisines that you can try in New York’s many restaurants. You can enjoy world-class performances everywhere from Broadway to the corner bar. Or you can feel like an “insider” by exploring Broadway theaters and Times Square with an actual Broadway performer!</p>

				<p>If NYC is the heavy hitter for the East Coast, then Los Angeles takes the title for the West. The glitz and glamor of Hollywood is known all over the world, making this one of the most famous cities in the US. From the stunning beaches of the county to the countless celebs, LA has beauty wherever you look.
				<br><br>
Disneyland (which is technically in Anaheim, within the Greater Los Angeles metropolitan area) isn’t the only place that feels magical in LA. The amazing food, unbelievable views, and iconic sites all make this place feel truly unique. There’s always been a bit of a NY vs. LA rivalry, but there’s room for both on this list.</p>

				<p>Take a 6-hour drive up the coast and you’ll find yourself in another one of the most famous cities in the United States: San Francisco. Instantly recognizable for the Golden Gate Bridge with its signature color and moody fog, this Bay Area city is distinct from its Southern California cousin.
				<br><br>
Whether you come for the landmarks, the tech industry, the food, or the culture, San Francisco has a lot to offer. But that doesn’t mean it’s all a walk in the park. Believe me, the city’s signature hills are no joke, and they’ll make you work for all the beautiful views.</p>

			<p>Move even further up the West Coast to enjoy the jewel of the Pacific Northwest. Seattle is a thriving city known for its seafood scene and dedication to nature. This famous US city is the home of the Space Needle, the Pike Place Market, and the first Starbucks. 
			<br><br>
Despite its cloudy and rainy reputation, Seattle has undeniable natural beauty. I love Mount Rainier, which serves as a stunning backdrop to the unique city skyline. Plus, the Puget Sound
