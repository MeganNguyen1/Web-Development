				<h4>MAY 18, 2024</h4>

			<section>
				<p>What makes a classic American city? Is it the food, the culture, the history? The answer is different for each and every iconic destination. From coast to coast, this country is filled with famous US cities that shouldn’t be missed.
				<br><br>
Let’s take a look at the 16 most famous cities in the USA.</p>

				<h2>1. New York</h2>

				<p>The Big Apple is easily the most famous city in the US. With notable interest points like Times Square, the Empire State Building, the Brooklyn Bridge, and One World Trade Center, there’s always something to see here. If there’s one place to visit in the country, it’s undoubtedly New York City.
				<br><br>
But New York is much more than that! Beyond the typical tourist spots, there are hidden gems you can uncover in every neighborhood.
				<br><br>
If you’re like me, you’ll love the variety of cuisines that you can try in New York’s many restaurants. You can enjoy world-class performances everywhere from Broadway to the corner bar. Or you can feel like an “insider” by exploring Broadway theaters and Times Square with an actual Broadway performer!</p>

				<p>If NYC is the heavy hitter for the East Coast, then Los Angeles takes the title for the West. The glitz and glamor of Hollywood is known all over the world, making this one of the most famous cities in the US. From the stunning beaches of the county to the countless celebs, LA has beauty wherever you look.
				<br><br>
Disneyland (which is technically in Anaheim, within the Greater Los Angeles metropolitan area) isn’t the only place that feels magical in LA. The amazing food, unbelievable views, and iconic sites all make this place feel truly unique. There’s always been a bit of a NY vs. LA rivalry, but there’s room for both on this list.</p>

				<h2>3. San Francisco</h2>

				</figure>
				<p>Take a 6-hour drive up the coast and you’ll find yourself in another one of the most famous cities in the United States: San Francisco. Instantly recognizable for the Golden Gate Bridge with its signature color and moody fog, this Bay Area city is distinct from its Southern California cousin.
				<br><br>
Whether you come for the landmarks, the tech industry, the food, or the culture, San Francisco has a lot to offer. But that doesn’t mean it’s all a walk in the park. Believe me, the city’s signature hills are no joke, and they’ll make you work for all the beautiful views.</p>

				</figure>
				<p>Move even further up the West Coast to enjoy the jewel of the Pacific Northwest. Seattle is a thriving city known for its seafood scene and dedication to nature. This famous US city is the home of the Space Needle, the Pike Place Market, and the first Starbucks. 
				<br><br>
Despite its cloudy and rainy reputation, Seattle has undeniable natural beauty. I love Mount Rainier, which serves as a stunning backdrop to the unique city skyline. Plus, the Puget Sound

				<p>Hop across America to the opposite coast and you’ll find another city with an important body of water. The city of Boston (with its infamous harbor) is a well-known destination that’s not to be missed. History buffs and sports fans alike thrive in this Northeastern city.
				<br><br>
If you’re looking for a bite to eat, Boston has no shortage of delicious dishes. Clam chowder, lobster rolls, baked beans, and cream pies are all famous foods in the area.
				<br><br>
When you’re done eating, you can wash it all down with a local Samuel Adams beer. If you’re curious about Boston’s craft beer scene or simply want a taste of the city’s popular beers, I recommend this guided brewery tour that includes three different Boston breweries.</p>

				<p>If you’re looking for even more American history, you’ll definitely find it in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Many important events during the founding of this country occurred right in this very city.
				<br><br>
But Philadelphia is way more than just its history. It has a rich, diverse culture made famous on the silver screen. Whether you take a run up the Rocky steps or run around town chasing treasure like Nicolas Cage, there are plenty of iconic places to visit.
				<br><br>
To top it all off, no trip to Philly would be complete without one of the city’s famous cheesesteaks. Many would recommend tourist favorites like Pat’s or Geno’s, but I say search for your own hidden gem. </p>

The amount of information and knowledge to be gained in this city is limitless. There are countless museums that showcase the best of human and animal history. And most of these offer free entry.
				<br><br>
One of my favorites is the Museum of Natural History, which is just one of the many Smithsonian museums that are worth exploring. You can explore it on your own but a guided tour

				<p>The final East Coast city on this list is unlike any other. Miami is a famous US city that sometimes doesn’t really feel American at all. Miami is known for its distinctly Latin flair and influence. 
				<br><br>
With its close proximity to the Caribbean and Latin America, Miami takes cues from and combines a wide variety of different cultures. You’ll find delicious dishes with plenty of spice and Spanish music bumping from every corner. The food scene, the nightlife, and the art scene are all what make Miami so exciting. </p>

Of course, we can’t talk about New Orleans without mentioning Mardi Gras. This spring celebration is known for being a lively street party that’s not to be missed. Floats, costumes, live music, and drinks are all integral parts of the week-long party. </p>
