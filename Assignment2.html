<p>To Canadians who fear the changes that this will bring to this country, I can say to them, that there is no downside to justice

<p>One of the great indigenous leaders of the last generation, Arthur Manuel died in January 2017 at the age of 65. His framing of indigenous 
pauperization and indigenous pauperization and indigenous sovereignty as questions of international law, and his challenges to the 
<a href="#">doctrine of discovery</a>, set the tone for a new generation of indigenous Canadian activists in the late twentieth and early 
twenty-first centuries. A brilliant tactician, he built international alliances while also working tirelessly at a local and regional 
level in the <a href="#">Shuswap Nation</a> and in the Bc Interior. In his books <i>Unsettling Canada</i> and <i>the Reconcoliation Manifesto</i>, 
he laid out a framework for indigenous rights that remains enormously influential in indigenous movements across Canada.</p>
